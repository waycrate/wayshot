# - none: no filtering (best for low bit depth grayscale or low color count)
# - sub: filters based on previous pixel in the same scanline
# - up: filters based on the scanline above
# - avg: filters based on average of left and right neighbor pixels
# - paeth: algorithm using left, upper left, and above pixels
# - adaptive: heuristic selection of filters per scanline

# For more info, run `cjxl -h`

# Set lossless
lossless = false

# Target visual distance in JND units, lower = higher quality.
# 0.0 = mathematically lossless. Default for already-lossy input (JPEG/GIF).
# 1.0 = visually lossless. Default for other input.
# Recommended range: 0.5 .. 3.0. Allowed range: 0.0 ... 25.0. Mutually exclusive with --quality.
# If `lossless` is set to `true`, this value is unused and implied to be 0.
distance = 1

# Encoder effort setting. Range: 1 .. 10.
# Default: 7. Higher numbers allow more computation at the expense of time.
# For lossless, generally it will produce smaller files.
# For lossy, higher effort should more accurately reach the target quality.
